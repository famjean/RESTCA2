# Supplementary methods    

## Data collection      
Participants were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire. The DSM-5 criteria were evaluated for eating disorders (EDs) and comorbidities. Questions about socio-demographic characteristics, mental health, and care were included. Participants completed the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) (Garner et al., 1982; Leichner et al., 1994). This scale is a self-report questionnaire that measures a wide range of eating disorder symptoms. The questionnaire included questions about clinical data, such as height (m), weight (kg) and calculation of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m²).
Details of the questions and response options can be found in the supplementary material.   


## Statistical method  
*Description*   
We described numeric variables using the mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables using percentages and counts. We analysed the sample with no missing values for question about barriers to treatment.   

*Textual responses preprocessing*   
Analyses were conducted using available cases. The set of textual responses was tokenized. Then punctuation, numbers, special characters, capital letters, and meaningless words were removed. Next we applied a lemmatization (process of transformed an inflected word to his canonical form).   

*Natural language processing*
First, we describe the responses by computing the word count and calculating the TTR (type-token ratio, i.e. the ratio of number word types to number of words) and sparsity. For a response, sparsity is the percentage of tokens that do not appear in the other responses; for the set of responses, it is the average sparsity.

Secondly, we conducted topic modelling (TP) on the preprocessed set of responses. TP is a statistical model used to discover hidden semantic structures within a body of text. We chose the biterm topic model because it is adapted to short texts, such as the responses we studied, and outperforms other TP techniques [@yanBitermTopicModel2013]. In the supplementary material, we display the results of latent dirichlet allocation.   

Thirdly, we used Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) to automatically analyse the set of responses. GPT is a type of large language model used to generate text from a prompt. Raw, rather than pre-processed, data was used for the LLM. The prompt was: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx". 

More details on methods are presented in supplementary material.   


Data collection
The first section consisted of verifying, according to DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association & American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Call et al., 2013), that the recruited patients did indeed have an ED currently undergoing treatment. The evaluators also applied the DSM-5 criteria, including the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Three questions were asked at the end of this section to inquire about a history of suicide attempts and the presence of suicidal ideation.
The second part consisted of a questionnaire designed to gather socio-demographic data from the patient, including: including: nationality, age (in years + months), number of siblings (count), number of half-siblings (count), parents separated (yes/no), duration of separation (not applicable, years), educational or professional status (middle school, high school, other secondary education, university, preparatory class, other tertiary education, paid work, unemployed, other), number of brothers and sisters (count), number of half-brothers and half-sisters (count), separated parents (yes/no), duration of separation (not applicable, years), socio-professional category of parent 1 (CSP1: farmers, CSP2: artisans, merchants, business owners, CSP3: executives and higher intellectual professions, CSP4: intermediate professions, CSP5: employees, CSP 6: workers), socio-professional category of parent 2 (CSP1: farmers, CSP2: artisans, merchants, business owners, CSP3: executives and higher intellectual professions, CSP4: intermediate professions, CSP5: employees, CSP 6: workers, extracurricular activities (open question), leisure activities (open question), place of residence (city (>5,000 inhabitants) (“City,” 2023), countryside, large metropolis), educational grants (yes, no, not applicable), disability allowance for adults (yes, no, not applicable), RSA (yes, no, not applicable), tobacco use (yes, no), if yes, number of cigarettes smoked per day (count), alcohol consumption (yes, no), if yes, frequency of use (once a year, once a month or less, once a week or less, more than twice a week, every day), occasional heavy drinking in the evening (yes, no), psychoactive substance use (yes, no), if yes, type of psychoactive substance use (cocaine, opioids, cannabis, MDMA, methamphetamine, other) and frequency of psychoactive substance use  (once a year, once a month or less, once a week or less, more than twice a week, every day), use of medication without a prescription or beyond the prescription (yes, no), if yes, type of medication (Stilnox, Seresta, codeine, morphine, other) and frequency of use (once a year, once a month or less, once a week or less, more than twice a week, every day).
In the third part, participants were asked to complete the following self-administered questionnaire.
The Eating Attitudes Test – 26 items (EAT-26) (Garner et al., 1982; Leichner et al., 1994): This scale is a self-report questionnaire that measures a wide range of eating disorder symptoms. It includes 26 items with 3 subscales exploring 3 domains: food restriction, binge eating and food concerns, and control overeating. A score of 20 or higher is considered to reflect significant ED symptoms.
The fourth part focused on questions that specifically inquired about the participants' ED and their use of SM: Age of onset of body weight concerns (years), age of onset of physical appearance concerns (years), age of onset of food-related concerns (years), age of onset of deliberate weight modification behaviors (weight loss, vomiting, intensive physical activity, or other) (years), age of onset of weight loss (years), age of onset of medical consultations for ED (years), duration of treatment by an ED professional (month, year(s)), hospitalization for an ED (yes, no), age at acquisition of the first mobile phone (years), age at start of social media use (years), social media platforms used by the patient in life (open-ended response), type of social media usage (viewing only, content creation & commenting), viewing ED-related content on social media (yes, no, not applicable), if yes, age at first exposure to social media content on ED (years), if yes, what type of content related to EDs (type 1 : focused on weight loss, type 2 : focused on recovery, type 3 : both types), if yes, maximum age of use of social media on EDs, viewing ED-related content in the past month (yes, no, not applicable), if yes, what type of content related to EDs in the past month (type 1 : focused on weight loss, type 2 : focused on recovery, type 3 : both types), following ED-related influencers on social media (yes, no, not applicable), following ED-related influencers in the past month (yes, no, not applicable), purchasing from these influencers' accounts for weight loss (yes, no, not applicable), purchasing from these influencers' accounts for ED recovery  (yes, no, not applicable), consulting a professional coach for weight loss (yes, no, not applicable), consulting a professional coach for ED recovery (yes, no, not applicable).
Finally, the last part of the questionnaire included the collection of clinical data such as height (m), weight (kg), and body mass index (BMI) calculation (kg/m²).

Missing data management
Missing data were removed, and analyses were conducted using available cases (Rubin, 1976). for each statistical test, based on the variables analyzed in that test.
Normality Assessment
A distribution was considered normal if the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro & Wilk, 1965), the Anderson-Darling test (Anderson & Darling, 1952), and the Jarque-Bera test (Jarque & Bera, 1987) all confirmed normality. Combining a test based on the distribution of quantiles relative to a normal law, a test based on the empirical cumulative distribution function, and a test based on moments ensures a conservative approach to defining normality.

Tokenisation https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Tokenization is the process of converting a string of characters into a list of individual pieces of text, called tokens, based on a reference. Tokens can be words, symbols, or punctuation. By example: "The car costs 4000$." is decomposed to "The", "car", "costs", "4000", "$", ".".

Lemmatiezation is the process of transformed an inflected word to his canonical form called a lemma. By example, "men" becomes "man", "is" becomes "be", and "cats" becomes "cat".

A generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) is a type of large language model (LLM)[1][2][3] that is widely used in generative AI chatbots.[4][5] GPTs are based on a deep learning architecture called the transformer. They are pre-trained on large datasets of unlabeled content, and able to generate novel content

Natural language processing is the processing of natural language by a computer.
