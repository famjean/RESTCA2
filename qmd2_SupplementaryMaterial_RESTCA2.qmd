## Study design   
This study forms part of the RESTCA project. The RESTCA project is a cross-sectional, descriptive, multicentre study recruiting participants diagnosed with an eating disorder (ED). The project aimed to collect information on social media usage, eating disorder (ED) characteristics, lifestyle, psychiatric comorbidities, and care. It took place at three centres in the Hauts-de-France region of France between January 2024 and January 2025.      

The RESTCA project was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons under the reference number 2023-A02380-45. Participants received a letter providing information about the study's objectives. Major patients gave their written consent. Both minor patients and their parents completed a written consent form.    

## Population    
The inclusion criteria were: participants had to be aged between 12 and 30 years; have been clinically diagnosed with an eating disorder (ED) by a psychiatrist; and have been monitored for more than six months for an eating disorder.   

Exclusion criteria included: individuals with autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder, individuals who did not understand spoken French and were unable to read it, individuals with a severe sensory impairment that limited or prevented them from completing the questionnaires (visual impairment, deafness, etc.), individuals hospitalized full-time, being pregnant, being homeless, and being incarcerated.   

## Data collection   
Participants were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire. The DSM-5 criteria were evaluated for eating disorders (EDs). Questions about age and sex were asked. Participants completed the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) [@leichnerValidationDuneEchelle1994; @garnerEatingAttitudesTest1982]. This scale is a self-report questionnaire that measures a wide range of eating disorder symptoms. The questionnaire included questions about clinical data, such as height (m), weight (kg) and calculation of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m²).  

## Barriers to treatment    
Participants were asked an open-response question in French: *'Quelque chose vous a-t-il empêché d’obtenir l’aide dont vous aviez besoin au début de votre prise en soin ?  (regard des autres, argent, peur de grossir, stigma, religion, autres… ). Détaillez.'*; English translation: *'Did anything prevent you from getting the help you needed at the beginning of your treatment? (other people's opinions, money, fear of gaining weight, stigma, religion, other reasons, etc.). Please provide details.'*.   

## Statistical method     
### Description    
We described numeric variables using the mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables using percentages and counts. We analysed the sample with no missing values for question about barriers to treatment.  

### Textual responses preprocessing   
The set of textual responses was tokenized excluding missing values.  Xxxxx   Then punctuation, numbers, special characters, capital letters, and meaningless words were removed. Next we applied a lemmatization (process of transformed an inflected word to his canonical form).   

### Natural language processing: main methods   
First, we calculated the total word count, the mean (and sd) number of words per response, and for all responses the type-token ratio (TTR) and the sparsity. Then, we calculated across the responses the mean TTR and mean sparsity. The TTR is the ratio of word types to words. Sparsity is the ratio of absent words to all used words in the set of responses.     

Secondly, we conducted topic modelling (TP) on the preprocessed set of responses. TP is a statistical model used to discover hidden semantic structures within a body of text. We chose the biterm topic model because it is adapted to short texts, such as the responses we studied, and outperforms other TP techniques [@yanBitermTopicModel2013]. In the supplementary material, we display the results of other techniques.   

Thirdly, we used Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) to automatically analyse the set of responses. GPT is a type of large language model (LLM) used to generate text from a prompt. Raw, rather than pre-processed, data was used for the LLM. The prompt was: *"Analyse et synthètise les réponses à la question 'Quelque chose vous a-t-il empêché d’obtenir l’aide dont vous aviez besoin au début de votre prise en soin ?  (regard des autres, argent, peur de grossir, stigma, religion, autres… ). Détaillez.'. Les réponses à la question sont : xxx Prends en compte que chaque individu a sa réponse après un chiffre et un slash et deux points (exemple : '1/: réponse'). Prends en compte que cette question a été posé à des patients souffrant d'un trouble du comportement alimentaire lors d'une étude clinique. Donne une réponse en moins de 200 mots et plus de 150 mots en anglais. Ne demande pas d'informations complémentaires dans ta réponse. Ne fait pas de commentaires autres dans ta réponse."*. xxx is the response of participants numbered (example: 1/: response of the first participant; 2/: response of the second participant). Seed and temperature were fixed at xxx and xxxx respectively.

### Versions   
We used the R language version XXXXXXXX [], llama.cpp version xx [], modelxxx version xxx [], and treetragger 3.2.5 [].

## Missing data    
Figure S1 shows the study's flowchart. It presents the number of patients who refused or withdrew from the study, as well as the number of missing values.

### Determining the numer of latent topic    
In the Figure S2, we see that the optimal number of latent topic was three.
